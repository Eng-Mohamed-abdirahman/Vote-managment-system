## Problem Statement

In many voting systems, users face challenges such as lack of accessibility, security concerns, and inefficient management. 
These issues can lead to miscounted votes, unauthorized voting, and a lack of confidence in the process. This project addresses
these challenges by creating a secure platform that allows only verified users to vote, thus ensuring integrity and reliability in voting outcomes.

## Solution

The Vote Management System addresses these issues through its sign-in functionality, which ensures that only authenticated users can cast their votes. 
The system utilizes localStorage to store user data securely, allowing only the signed-in user to participate in the voting.

## Technologies Used

HTML: Used for structuring the content of the application.
CSS: Applied to style and layout the user interface, ensuring a clean and engaging design.
JavaScript: Powers the dynamic functionality and interactive features, including the voting process, user authentication, and data storage.
API Integration: The Weather API is integrated to provide real-time weather data, adding an extra layer of user engagement and context.
